*Parallel factor ChIP provides essential internal control for quantitative differential ChIP-seq*
https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/46/12/e75/4972874
Using ChIP on CTCF on the same samples to control for sample processing noise- sonication, nuclear extract etc 
- use counts within the non change CTCF peaksa nd use this coefficent as size factor or library normalisation 
- standard normalisations for chip 
  - reads per million (RPM)
  - reads in peaks
  - rPM total reads 
  RPM aligned reads
